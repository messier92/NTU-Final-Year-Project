cICAdemo is a demo file for simulations of cICA algorithm, which was first proposed in

Wei Lu, Jagath C. Rajapakse: ICA with reference. ICA 2001

The demo file shows that the original cICA algorithm is very sensitive to the reference signals and parameters of the algorithm. For detailed analysis and a robust algorithm, see:
