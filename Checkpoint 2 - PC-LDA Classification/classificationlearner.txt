Steps to classify using LDA on MATLAB:

[from Raman Spectra, get PCA of all 14 or 32 datasets. THEN transpose it to only get the first 2 columns which we want.
Save the first 2 columns only and add in the Type in the .csv file.]

On MATLAB 2015b, type in [fishertable = readtable('fisheriris.csv');]
or import your own .csv file and read the csv as TABLE. 
MUST MAKE IT IN TABLE FORMAT.

Start 'Classification Learner' on App, the model should already be preloaded.
Predictors are FirstFeature and SecondFeature and Response is Class Type.

Select Linear Discriminant and Train model to get results.
